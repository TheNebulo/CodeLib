# Python Snippets

These are all the `python` code snippets used by myself on repeat amidst my projects.

Code that is directly in this root folder aren't context specific and don't rely on anything outside the snippet itself.

Code within folders require a certain framework such as `Flask`, and hence are dependant on an existing ecosystem.

Docstrings are ideally present on any complicated functions.

> Each snippet will require it's modules that can be found at the top of the file.
