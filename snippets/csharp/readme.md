# C# Snippets

These are all the `c#` code snippets used by myself on repeat amidst my projects.

Code that is directly in this root folder aren't context specific and don't rely on anything outside the snippet itself. These however can rarely be used outside of a .NET of Unity context.

Code within folders require a certain framework such as `unity`, and hence are dependant on an existing ecosystem.

Documentation is ideally present on any complicated functions.
